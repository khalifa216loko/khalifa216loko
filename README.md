# Hi there, I'm Ben Khlifa ⭐️

### Junior Web Developer

I am a passionate junior web developer with a solid foundation in web development, thanks to my education at Beam Institute. I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive web applications, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.


Fun fact: I once answered the world’s oldest question with a single line of JavaScript
Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
console.log(["🥚", "🐣", "🐥", "🐔"].sort())

>>> ["🐔", "🐣", "🐥", "🥚"];
